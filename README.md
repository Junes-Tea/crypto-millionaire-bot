While yes this claims to be an AI agent and as far as the programing goes it is elegant and should hopefully run. If you use real money to run this and you lose it all, well my friend you shouldn't have done that. you are what we in the trade call SOL. Shit out of luck. If you use this you do so at your own risk and by using it you have agreed to that statement. If you make millions well done, I hope you use it wisely and live well as a person who makes their mum proud. 
If you find that your life is pointless and meaningless as a millionaire if this actually works, I recomend reading the book of eclesiastes from the Bible. It is King Solomons wisdom that he had gathered from owning everything and having nobody able to refuse him anything. Basically he had it all and found it meaningless and a great chasing after the wind. That vacuuos empty wealth feeling still exists today. 
All the best, good luck feel free to use this as a base line and make something monumental from it and with it. Be blessed.
